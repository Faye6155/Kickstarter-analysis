Kickstarting with Excel

Overview of Project

Purpose
This project is to give the students chances to practice the excel functions to create filter, pivot tables to sort information. Students can apply different fomula to get the information they need for the further analysis.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- In this analysis, we need to convert the launch date from the origin spreadsheet into readable date. Create the pivot table based on the existing information. Understand the use of filter, row and columns. 

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- In this analysis, the COUNTIFS, SUM would be applied to get the information needed for the analysis. 
This analysis is more about practicing the calcultions and logics to have. 


Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- Before reading all the class material, I started the project. The coding launching date was the first challenge I faced. I used google to search the method to convert the date to readable. However, the most useful material is the module content itself. I applied all the steps in modules then started the project again. It works much efficient. 


Two conclusions about the Outcomes based on Launch Date

- May has the most successful launches for theater which is over 111. 
- The trend of successful launches and failed launches are similar through the months. 

Conclusions about the Outcomes based on Goals

- 25000-34999 is the range for the lower successful rate and higher failed rate. This means the goals set to this range is not easy for the plays to get the expected outcomes.
- For plays, lower the goal would get the higher successful rate and lower failed rate.
- The goal set more than 500000, is very risky to get the plays successful and highly rate to be failed.


Limitations for the dataset

- This dataset has the 'live' launches which is not meaningful for the analysis because the data for live is very limited.
- The currency are different based on the area. This is not clear if we make the analysis to compare country by country. 


Other possible tables/graphs to create
- Profit analysis for based on the 'goal' and 'pledged' info. 
- Live time for each launch last in the market (Deadline-Launched date).
